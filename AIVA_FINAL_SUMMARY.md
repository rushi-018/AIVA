# AIVA - Agentic Intelligent Voice Assistant

## Final Implementation Summary

### üéØ Project Overview

Successfully implemented a complete minimal working prototype of AIVA (Agentic Intelligent Voice Assistant) with the following pipeline:
**ASR ‚Üí NLU ‚Üí Core ‚Üí Perception ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Response**

### ‚úÖ Key Achievements

#### 1. **AI-Powered Product Recommendations**

- **Smart Recommendations System** (`smart_recommendations.py`)
  - Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for semantic matching
  - Extracts meaningful features: brand recognition, rating quality, price reasonableness
  - Composite scoring with multiple criteria (smart/price/rating)
  - Intelligent explanations for recommendations

#### 2. **Universal Product Search**

- **Robust DOM Parsing** (`perception.py`)
  - Works across all product categories (tested: earphones, headphones, smartphones)
  - Price-anchor based element detection (CSS-class agnostic)
  - Universal price limit filtering
  - Reliable product information extraction

#### 3. **Intelligent Shopping Loop**

- **Smart Cart Management** (`interactive_session.py`)
  - Persistent browser sessions
  - Intelligent product selection with AI recommendations
  - Add to Cart automation with multiple fallback methods
  - User review and retry mechanisms

#### 4. **Complete Modular Architecture**

- **ASR Module** (`asr.py`): Speech-to-text with text input fallback
- **NLU Module** (`nlu.py`): Intent and entity extraction
- **Core Module** (`core.py`): ReAct reasoning loop
- **Perception Module** (`perception.py`): DOM parsing and product detection
- **Executor Module** (`executor.py`): Action execution
- **Response Module** (`response.py`): Result formatting

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### AI Recommendations

```python
# Smart recommendation scoring
features = {
    'has_brand': brand_recognition,
    'rating': quality_scoring,
    'price_ratio': value_assessment,
    'semantic_match': tfidf_similarity
}
final_score = semantic_similarity + feature_boosts
```

#### Universal Product Search

```python
# Price-anchor based detection
price_elements = driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, '//*[contains(text(), "‚Çπ")]')
# Navigate DOM tree to find product containers
# Extract title, price, rating from container text
```

#### Add to Cart Automation

```python
# Multiple navigation methods:
# 1. Direct element clicking
# 2. Link-based navigation
# 3. URL reconstruction
# 4. Fresh element re-finding

# Comprehensive button detection
add_to_cart_selectors = [
    '//button[contains(translate(text(), "ABC", "abc"), "add to cart")]',
    # ... 15+ different selector strategies
]
```

### üß™ Testing Results

#### AI Recommendations Test

- ‚úÖ Semantic similarity working correctly
- ‚úÖ Brand recognition (Sony, JBL, OnePlus, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Feature extraction (wireless, gaming, mic)
- ‚úÖ Intelligent scoring and explanations

#### Product Search Test

- ‚úÖ Universal search across categories
- ‚úÖ Accurate price filtering
- ‚úÖ Reliable product detection (10+ products found consistently)

#### Cart Automation Test

- ‚úÖ Add to Cart button detection working on product pages
- ‚úÖ Navigation to product pages (with fallbacks)
- ‚úÖ Cart verification and management

### üìä Performance Metrics
